## Getting started ##

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/shahvicky/slack-user-sync-api.git
cd slack-user-sync-api

## Setup ##

To run the app locally, you need to have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

Have a local setup ready by running:
```
npm run setup:up
```
This starts the dependencies (only MySQL for now) locally in docker container

To stop and remove containers created by `npm run setup:up`, by running:
```
npm run setup:down
```

Start Server:
```
node index.js
```

## Environment Variables ##

Please see [doc/env.md](doc/env.md) for the possible environment variables.

Along with the above, to run in production, you need `NODE_ENV=production` and a `.env` file inside `tools/` dir.
For local, environment variables from `local.env` inside `tools/` is used
